# Snake-and-Ladders-Game

This game is learned during javascript tutorials which was designed using Vanilla JavaScript and can be played by a single player.


To run this, you can download `index.html` and `game.js` and open `index.html` in your browser.

* Note: This game has not covered most of the edge cases since it's a simple game coded for beginners. Also, it is single player for now.
